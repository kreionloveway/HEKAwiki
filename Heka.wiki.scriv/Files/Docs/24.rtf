\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Earth Mother Gaia and Sky Father Sol are two of the four celestial grandparents each human has. The other two are the First Father and First Mother archetypes. Many creationists consider the first father (and mother) to be the creator(s) who conceived the manifest universe including Gaia and Sol. I consider it more likely that the human personifications of God and Goddess arose later, about the same time as human consciousness crystallized. Since divine spirits are inherently transdimensional, however, it is difficult to conceive of any meaningful sense of cause and effect, or location on a timeline. Instead we can consider these things to be \hich\f0 \ldblquote \loch\f0 mutually arising.\hich\f0 \rdblquote \loch\f0 }
